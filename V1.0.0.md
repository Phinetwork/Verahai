# Verahai SigilMarkets v1.0.0 — Official Release Notes

**Release codename:** *Portable Truth*
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Public, production-grade foundation

---

## What this is (in plain English)

**Verahai SigilMarkets is a prediction market where the “receipt” is the product.**
When you take a position or finalize an outcome, you don’t just create a database row—you mint a **sigil glyph** that *contains the proof* of what happened.

That means your market activity becomes:

* **Portable** (a single SVG you can carry anywhere)
* **Verifiable** (proof travels with the artifact)
* **Offline-first** (no server required to *keep truth intact*)
* **Future-proof** (you can still validate it years later)

This release is big because it flips the normal model on its head:

> Most apps store truth in servers and show you screenshots.
> Verahai stores truth **inside the thing you share.**

---

## Why this matters

### 1) Truth stops being hosted—truth becomes held

If your proof depends on a company’s database, it’s not really yours.
With Verahai, the **proof is embedded**, so anyone can independently validate it without trusting your infrastructure.

### 2) Markets become peer-to-peer objects

A “position” is no longer “something in an account.”
It’s a **cryptographically bound artifact** that can be passed, archived, audited, and replayed.

### 3) Offline is not a downgrade—offline is the upgrade

Offline-first means:

* resilience to outages
* resilience to platform bans
* resilience to broken links
* resilience to “oops the service is down” moments

When the proof is inside the artifact, the system survives.

## What we shipped in v1.0.0

### ✅ Core: Sigil-native prediction markets

* **Position Sigils (SM-POS-1):** a minted glyph representing a market position with embedded metadata and integrity hashing.
* **Resolution Sigils (SM-RES-1):** a minted glyph representing a finalized resolution event.
* **Ring-encoded data design:** important provenance is encoded on the artifact itself, not in a hidden database record.
* **Deterministic layout + no-overlap rules:** the sigil is not a random image—its structure is reproducible and carries meaning.

### ✅ ZK-forward verification posture

* The system is built so “verified” isn’t a marketing word—it’s a **first-class state**.
* Proof bundles / public inputs are treated as portable verification material and are included with the artifact’s provenance flow.

### ✅ Offline-first storage + lifecycle

* Positions, vault actions, and market state are designed to persist locally as a first principle, not an afterthought.
* The UX is built for the reality that networks fail—**truth shouldn’t**.

### ✅ Export that actually means something

* One-click **SVG export** (the canonical artifact)
* **PNG rendering** for sharing (while preserving the SVG as the source-of-truth)
* Metadata and descriptions remain embedded so the artifact can be inspected later.

### ✅ Oracle resolution surface (MVP transport layer)

* A clean boundary between:

  * **policy** (what should happen)
  * and **transport** (how a resolution is expressed and carried)
* This matters because it makes the oracle replaceable without rewriting the system.

## The deeper accomplishment (what you may not realize yet)

Most systems do this:

* UI shows something
* Server “means it”
* Database is the truth

Verahai does this:

* The artifact is the truth
* The UI renders the truth
* Servers are optional distribution, not authority

That architecture shift is the entire game.

**This is the first release where markets can produce objects that can outlive the app.**
That’s rare. And it’s the foundation for everything that comes next.

## What v1.0.0 guarantees

**Integrity**

* Sigils are hash-addressable and tamper-evident: if someone edits it, it won’t validate.

**Portability**

* A sigil can be copied, stored, posted, emailed, backed up—without losing its ability to be checked.

**Auditability**

* You can inspect metadata, verify hashes, and reconstruct the semantic “what happened” story from the artifact itself.

**Offline resilience**

* A position doesn’t disappear when Wi-Fi does. The system still functions and still remembers.

---

## What this becomes (long-term vision)

### Long-term vision: “Markets as a universal proof format”

A Verahai sigil isn’t just a receipt for one app—it’s a **standard container** for:

* claims
* positions
* outcomes
* signatures
* evidence bundles
* verification material

**Prediction markets are the first killer use case** because they demand resolution, provenance, and adversarial robustness.
But the format generalizes to *any* claim that needs truth over time.

### Super long-term vision: “Truth objects as infrastructure”

In the super long arc, Verahai becomes a world where:

* **Proof moves at the speed of copying**, not at the speed of institutions.
* The “internet of value” evolves into an **internet of verifiable statements**.
* Sigils become a primitive like PDFs—but for truth:

  * A PDF preserves appearance
  * A Sigil preserves **provability**

And eventually:

* markets become composable
* resolutions become multi-oracle + multi-evidence
* sigils become cross-app identity + ownership containers
* “settlement” becomes a public, deterministic, replayable procedure

---

## What’s next after v1.0.0 (directionally)

* **Full verification UX:** “drop a sigil → instantly validate → show provenance + proof health”
* **Evidence-first resolution flows:** evidence bundles, hashing, and replayable decision records
* **Peer distribution:** sigils and resolution objects syncing without centralized authority
* **Composability:** positions that can be combined, netted, delegated, escrowed—without becoming server-dependent
* **Standardization:** stable formats so artifacts made today still verify years from now

---

## A note from the builder

v1.0.0 is not “we made an app.”
v1.0.0 is **we shipped a new primitive**:

> A verifiable, portable truth artifact
> that can represent a market action
> and survive outside the platform that created it.

That’s what makes this release real.
